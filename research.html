Even with a list, contacting randomly selected individuals across the country could be logistically complex and expensive. Proposed Method: Stratified Random Sampling or Cluster Sampling. Stratified: Divide population into strata (universities or regions), then randomly sample from each stratum. Ensures representation from different universities. Better if skill levels might vary by university. Cluster: Divide population into clusters (e.g., universities or districts), randomly select some clusters, then sample all or randomly sample individuals within selected clusters. More feasible if a full list is unavailable but lists within clusters (universities) are. Might be less statistically efficient than stratified if clusters are very different.'

Problem: A respondent might be satisfied with their salary but not find the work meaningful, or vice versa.

Justification: Collecting primary data (e.g., surveying people about their internet use 20 years ago) would be highly unreliable due to recall bias and infeasible for historical points. Secondary data is the only practical option. Sources: Nepal Telecommunications Authority (NTA) reports, Ministry of Communication and Information Technology (MoCIT) data, World Bank / ITU databases, academic studies, potentially old census data.
